## **Yet Another Physics Engine**
This is a student project aimed at creating a realistic physics engine. This project is built with the Simple DirectMedia Layer 2.0 library (SDL2).
## **Goals** 
What I intend to add to this project or account for. 
  * Force Vectors (Gravity, Friction, Applied Force, Centrifugal Force, Rotational Force)
  * Rigid Body Collisions
  * Inertia 
  * Compression 
  * Pendulums
Everything touched in AP Physics will be found in this project. 
## **Schedule**
There is no schedule for this project. Work will be completed when time is available.
